        The city of Lahore is urbanizing at an alarming rate, having grown almost 30% in the past 5 years, the city has layers of problems, one beneath the other, ready to manifest themselves. The politics of China and foreign investment has created conditions of dependencies and debt in the pursuit of endless economic growth. The research proposal stems from queries such as the factors which contribute to patterns of fragmented, unequal development in Lahore. How has urban renewal/development projects/policy impacted growth? What are the large urban transformations that have happened because of the urban renewal developments? The spatial and temporal dynamics of infrastructure development has instigated continued disparity and is highly distanced from the socio-spatial realities of the citizens. Some of the recurring thematic veiled in the urban fabric of Lahore, is erasure of image and memory of the locals through continued displacement, whether by Land mafia or “organized” by the government. There have been major legal encroachments in the form of private development over Public Squalor. Brand urbanism enfolded in the form of heritage conservation in the historic part of the city. The continued imposition of infrastructure projects resulted in displacement of people, loss of neighborhood character and street culture. All this stemming back to the root cause, the absence of a coherent National or Provincial urban policy, transforming Lahore into a fragmented city with a contested future.
